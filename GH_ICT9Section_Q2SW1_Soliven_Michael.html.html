They are medium to large in size, being 21.5-24.5 inches in height. They are good with children, seniors, other breeds of dogs and cats making them an ideal breed for any family. The reason why they are good with families is because they are friendly and playful most of the time.

They are very active dogs and the need for them to exercise is high.</dd></td>
